            <p>
              Going into deeper detail than what you will find on my resume above. I am very well versed in basic
              programming knowledge and languages (C++, Python, Java). I currently use many modern tools in my
              day-to-day development process, examples include git, GitHub, GDB, etc. In a more broad sense, I know of
              popular industry technologies & methods such as AWS, Test Driven Development, web server communication,
              and more. I enjoy stepping out of the norm when it comes to a normal development skillset. I love design,
              a large number of my technological years I have been doing graphics design with Photoshop and other
              software such as Illustrator. Before I got into software development I was creating logos and mockups for
              company ideas in my room. it always struck a chord with me on making something that was eye-catching and
              was something that you wanted to share with others. Tying back to a more computer science sense, I also
              found an operating system called Linux. When I first deep dove into Linux I was unaware of how deep it
              would go. You can do so many vast things with just a command line, much less a full-fledged desktop
              environment. Linux allowed me to express my creativity through the operating system itself, which was an
              amazing process, both in learning and enjoyment.

            <h4 class="text-bold">Web Development</h4>
            <p>
              I have been recently trying to shape my skillset to more of a web development role. In the world of
              computer science, just knowing an object-oriented language might not help you specify what you truly want
              to do. I began by picking up a major frontend library like React and also diving more into how to
              correlate with a web server and frameworks that come along with that (Node (Javascript), Spring Boot
              (Groovy, Java), Flask (Python)). During my previous internship with Dynata, I increased my knowledge of
              web development monumentally. I went into much deeper detail with React and how a web server truly plays
              its role. I have designed full-fledged APIs hosted within AWS to go along with a UI hosted in Amplify. But
              of your course, you can't speak of web development and not mention databases. I currently have only
              explored SQL-related database management systems (MySQL, Postgres, SQLite). I am comfortable navigating
              through a database and identifying the layout a company and/or project was striving for. I am also fluent
              in SQL and writing SQL and correlating a DBMS with a backend web server. Also, as mentioned before I have
              a deep background in UX-related design which has allowed me to create full-stack applications either on my
              own or within a large-scale company.

            <h4 class="text-bold">Web Development</h4>
            <p>
              As mentioned above my current technical interest lies heavily in web development. Creativity with
              programming has been something I have been striving for since I began. In certain areas of programming, it
              is hard to put a unique spin on things when outside restrictions are holding you back, or just the work
              relies on being done in a specific format. Yes, web development does have restrictions and request
              depending on if you are doing industry work or in a team, but it has the potential to be a free roam of
              your creativity. On the other side, backend technologies also provide a strong base in sticking to your
              fundamentals and providing you with that prime programming experience. Overall, it is an excellent mix of
              creativity and logical development.

            <h4 class="text-bold">Operating Systems</h4>
            <p>
              Although I love design, low-level code has also caught my interest. It provides a greater sense of control
              of your program as you tend to know a lot more about your memory management than in web development. That
              sense of control is a very nice feeling to have when writing code, it adds an extra sense of completeness
              when finishing a project. As mentioned above, I started to explore Linux early in school. It was also a
              question of mine why Linux was viewed in this such high spectacle when compared with something Windows,
              yes windows has an amazing user experience, but Linux gave us the software masterpiece for developers.
              Situations like these are what still draw me into operating systems and low-level today.
